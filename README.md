SwiftCRM-PY
SwiftCRM-PY is a comprehensive project that demonstrates the power of automated model creation, FastAPI routing, and efficient database handling using SQLAlchemy. This project showcases how modern Python frameworks and libraries can be utilized to build robust and scalable CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems with minimal manual coding.

Features
Automated Model Creation: Automatically generate SQLAlchemy models based on predefined schemas.
Dynamic FastAPI Routing: Automatically generate API routes for CRUD operations.
Database Management: Seamlessly handle database connections, migrations, and operations.
Middleware Integration: Implement middleware for handling authentication, logging, and other cross-cutting concerns.
Dedicated Validations: Separate folder for handling data validations to ensure data integrity and consistency.
Efficient Request Handling: Utilize FastAPI for high-performance asynchronous request handling.
Extensibility: Easily extend the system with new models and routes through a simple configuration.

Usage
Automated Model Creation
SwiftCRM-PY allows for automated model creation by defining schemas in the requests/schemas directory. The models are then used to generate database tables and CRUD operations.

Dynamic FastAPI Routing
The app/routes directory contains dynamically generated routes for the models. These routes handle typical CRUD operations, making it easy to interact with the API.

Middleware Integration
The app/middleware directory contains middleware for handling authentication, logging, and other cross-cutting concerns. This ensures that common functionalities are consistently applied across the application.

Dedicated Validations
The requests/validations directory is dedicated to data validation logic, ensuring that all incoming and outgoing data conforms to expected formats and constraints.

Database Management
Database connections and CRUD operations are managed using SQLAlchemy. The app/database directory contains the necessary configurations and CRUD operation implementations.

Request Handling
Utilizing FastAPI, SwiftCRM-PY provides high-performance asynchronous request handling. FastAPI's dependency injection system ensures smooth integration with the database and other services.
